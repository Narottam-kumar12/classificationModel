Setiment Analysis System

🧠 Overview

This project implements a robust Sentiment Analysis System built using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. 
It classifies text reviews as positive or negative, with an intelligent self-correcting fallback mechanism for ambiguous or low-confidence predictions.
This system is ideal for applications requiring real-time sentiment feedback with user interaction and correction for improved accuracy.

✅ Features

  🔍 Sentiment Classification :   Detects positive or negative sentiment in English reviews.

  ⚖️ Confidence Thresholding :    Flags predictions with low confidence for review.

  🙋 User Clarification Loop :    Allows human-in-the-loop correction for uncertain predictions.

  🧾 Logging :                    Records predictions, confidences, and user corrections.

  💻 Interactive CLI :            Command-line interface for user testing and feedback.

   ⚙️ Customizable Settingsn :      Easily configurable model and logging parameters.
